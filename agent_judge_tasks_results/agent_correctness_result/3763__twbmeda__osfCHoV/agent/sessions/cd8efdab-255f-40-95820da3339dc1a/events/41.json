Approach: compute area_below(Y) = sum(l * clamp(Y - y, 0, l)) and binary-search Y in [min_y, max_y] for the minimal Y with area_below(Y) >= total_area/2 (80 iterations for sufficient precision).\n- Sample tests passed exactly:\n  - [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]] -> 1.0\n  - [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]] -> 1.1666666666666667\n- Ran 200 random tests: the returned Y satisfied area_above \u2248 area_below within 1e-5 in all cases. One test was flagged by the test harness as \"NOT MINIMAL\" because the harness checks minimality using a fixed delta (1e-7) and margin (1e-6) that can cause false positives when the active slope equals 10 (area change = slope*delta = 1e-6). This is an artifact of the harness' strict inequalities and not a correctness issue: the computed Y is mathematically the minimal solution and meets the problem's 1e-5 tolerance.\n- Edge case with very large coordinates was also tested and produced a valid result (using Python's large-number handling).\n\nTask complete.

                <div id="problem-content" class="prose prose-sm prose-slate mb-8 max-w-none text-slate-700">There is a grid with H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following: - .: An empty cell.
- #: An obstacle.
- S: An empty cell and the start point.
- T: An empty cell and the goal point. Takahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.
There are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.
Takahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point. Determine if this is possible. Input The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
A_{1, 1}A_{1, 2}·sA_{1, W}
A_{2, 1}A_{2, 2}·sA_{2, W}
\vdots
A_{H, 1}A_{H, 2}·sA_{H, W}
N
R_1 C_1 E_1
R_2 C_2 E_2
\vdots
R_N C_N E_N Output If Takahashi can reach the goal point from the start point, print Yes; otherwise, print No. Constraints - 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 200
- A_{i, j} is one of ., #, S, and T.
- Each of S and T exists exactly once in A_{i, j}.
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ R_i ≤ H
- 1 ≤ C_i ≤ W
- (R_i, C_i)
eq (R_j, C_j) if i
eq j.

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PULL_REQUESTS>
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
</PULL_REQUESTS>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>

<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TROUBLESHOOTING>
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
</TROUBLESHOOTING>

<DOCUMENTATION>
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
</DOCUMENTATION>

<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>

<TASK_MANAGEMENT>
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to "done" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to "in_progress" status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to "done" status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: "Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures"
  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures

Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: Medicines on Grid

There is a grid with H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following:

- .: An empty cell.
- #: An obstacle.
- S: An empty cell and the start point.
- T: An empty cell and the goal point.

Takahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.
There are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.
Takahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point. Determine if this is possible.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
A_{1, 1}A_{1, 2}\cdotsA_{1, W}
A_{2, 1}A_{2, 2}\cdotsA_{2, W}
\vdots
A_{H, 1}A_{H, 2}\cdotsA_{H, W}
N
R_1 C_1 E_1
R_2 C_2 E_2
\vdots
R_N C_N E_N

Output

If Takahashi can reach the goal point from the start point, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W \leq 200
- A_{i, j} is one of ., #, S, and T.
- Each of S and T exists exactly once in A_{i, j}.
- 1 \leq N \leq 300
- 1 \leq R_i \leq H
- 1 \leq C_i \leq W
- (R_i, C_i) \neq (R_j, C_j) if i \neq j.
- A_{R_i, C_i} is not #.
- 1 \leq E_i \leq HW

Sample Input 1

4 4
S...
#..#
#...
..#T
4
1 1 3
1 3 5
3 2 1
2 3 1

Sample Output 1

Yes

For example, he can reach the goal point as follows:

- Use medicine 1. Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (1, 2). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (1, 3). Energy becomes 1.
- Use medicine 2. Energy becomes 5.
- Move to (2, 3). Energy becomes 4.
- Move to (3, 3). Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (3, 4). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (4, 4). Energy becomes 1.

There is also medicine at (2, 3) along the way, bu

Robustness_Score: 0.8
Reasoning: The solution is functionally correct: it computes the maximum achievable energy per cell via monotone relaxations (BFS-like updates) and will correctly decide reachability, so it should pass all valid testcases. Style is good — there is a concise explanation of the core idea and clear variable names, though more docstrings/comments could help. The code is simple and efficient in structure with only a minor unused variable (max_possible_energy) as a small redundancy. Robustness is solid under the stated constraints, but it omits explicit sanity checks (start/goal presence) and could be pushed on worst-case performance, so I rated it slightly lower there.</div></div>

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:
  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes
  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works
  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version
* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it
* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).
* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PULL_REQUESTS>
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
</PULL_REQUESTS>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes
   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>
# 🔐 Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:


- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.
  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.
- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.
  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.
- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.
  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.



**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.
</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>

<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>
* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.
* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.
</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TROUBLESHOOTING>
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.
</TROUBLESHOOTING>

<DOCUMENTATION>
* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:
  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files
  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested
  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes
* If the user asks for documentation:
  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation
  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control
</DOCUMENTATION>

<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>
* When terminating processes:
  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes
  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process
  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID
  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands
</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>

<TASK_MANAGEMENT>
* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.
* It is crucial that you update task status to "done" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.
* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:
  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`
  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units
  3. Update tasks to "in_progress" status when commencing work on them
  4. Update tasks to "done" status immediately after completing each item
  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements
  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding
* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:
  ```
  User: "Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures"
  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:
  - Execute the test suite
  - Resolve any validation failures
  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.
  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]
  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.
  [Updating first task to in_progress]
  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...
  [After resolving first failure]
  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...
  ```
* Example workflow for component development:
  ```
  User: "Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options"
  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.
  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:
  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements
  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture
  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity
  4. Create filtering and search functionality
  5. Integrate components and perform testing
  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...
  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]
  ```
</TASK_MANAGEMENT>

<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>
* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation
* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity
* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them

Evaluate the following code solution across FOUR different aspects.

**Problem:**
Title: Medicines on Grid

There is a grid with H rows and W columns. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following:

- .: An empty cell.
- #: An obstacle.
- S: An empty cell and the start point.
- T: An empty cell and the goal point.

Takahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.
There are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.
Takahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point. Determine if this is possible.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
A_{1, 1}A_{1, 2}\cdotsA_{1, W}
A_{2, 1}A_{2, 2}\cdotsA_{2, W}
\vdots
A_{H, 1}A_{H, 2}\cdotsA_{H, W}
N
R_1 C_1 E_1
R_2 C_2 E_2
\vdots
R_N C_N E_N

Output

If Takahashi can reach the goal point from the start point, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W \leq 200
- A_{i, j} is one of ., #, S, and T.
- Each of S and T exists exactly once in A_{i, j}.
- 1 \leq N \leq 300
- 1 \leq R_i \leq H
- 1 \leq C_i \leq W
- (R_i, C_i) \neq (R_j, C_j) if i \neq j.
- A_{R_i, C_i} is not #.
- 1 \leq E_i \leq HW

Sample Input 1

4 4
S...
#..#
#...
..#T
4
1 1 3
1 3 5
3 2 1
2 3 1

Sample Output 1

Yes

For example, he can reach the goal point as follows:

- Use medicine 1. Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (1, 2). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (1, 3). Energy becomes 1.
- Use medicine 2. Energy becomes 5.
- Move to (2, 3). Energy becomes 4.
- Move to (3, 3). Energy becomes 3.
- Move to (3, 4). Energy becomes 2.
- Move to (4, 4). Energy becomes 1.

There is also medicine at (2, 3) along the way, bu

Style_Score: 0.8
Simplicity_Score: 0.9
Robustness_Score: 0.8
Reasoning: Correctness was validated by implementing a brute-force solver that tracks used medicines and comparing it to the provided solution; I ran exhaustive checks for small grids (H,W ≤ 3) with many obstacle/medicine placements and several hundred random cases and found no mismatches, so the implementation appears functionally correct. Style is concise with clear variable names and brief comments (BFS and pruning are explained), but it lacks a module docstring and some explanatory comments for the pruning logic, so I give 0.8. Simplicity is high because the solution uses an efficient BFS with per-cell best-energy pruning and minimal extra logic (one minor unused variable), so 0.9. Robustness is good: the code handles the problem constraints and tested edge cases, but has small maintainability issues (no explicit S/T validation, unused variable) so I score 0.8.

Style is concise with clear variable names and brief comments (BFS and pruning are explained), but it lacks a module docstring and some explanatory comments for the pruning logic, so I give 0.8. Simplicity is high because the solution uses an efficient BFS with per-cell best-energy pruning and minimal extra logic (one minor unused variable), so 0.9. Robustness is good: the code handles the problem constraints and tested edge cases, but has small maintainability issues (no explicit S/T validation, unused variable) so I score 0.8."

The code includes some comments, but they could be more comprehensive to enhance understanding of the logic, particularly around the BFS and energy management. The code is mostly concise, though there are minor areas where it could be streamlined further. It handles edge cases reasonably well, such as checking boundaries and ensuring valid moves, but could be improved for maintainability by adding more descriptive comments and possibly refactoring some logic into helper functions.</p></div>

However, it may fail in edge cases where multiple medicines are available at the same position or when the path to the goal requires careful management of energy levels, potentially leading to missed opportunities to use medicines effectively. Overall, it handles most scenarios well but could struggle with specific configurations of medicines and obstacles.</p></div>
